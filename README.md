# Project Title: Travel Cost Calculator

Welcome to the Travel Cost Calculator project. This project aims to calculate the total cost of travel considering flight costs, hotel rates and currency exchange rates. It is designed to help you understand code quality, programming standards, design principles, and language syntax in Python and Java.

## Project Structure <a name="project-structure"></a>

Here is what the current project repository contains:

1. The main script `travel_cost_calculator.py` (for Python) and `TravelCostCalculator.java` (for Java), which calculates the total travel cost.
2. These scripts read data stored in various CSV files like `hotel_rates.csv`, `exchange_rates.csv`, and `flight_costs.csv` located in the `data` folder.

## Expectations <a name="expectations"></a>

1. **Code Quality**: Your code should be easy to read, properly indented, have informative variable names and insightful comments. Follow the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) style guide for Python and [Oracle Java Code Conventions](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-introduction.html) for Java.
2. **Code Efficiency**: The code should avoid redundancy and perform the calculations in the most efficient way possible.
3. **Error Handling**: The program should robustly handle potential errors such as missing data or invalid input.
4. **'Code Smells' Resolution**: Find and eliminate potential [code smells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell), which are symptoms in the code that could indicate a deeper problem.

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To run this project on a GitHub code space, instructions are already provided. If you wish to run this project locally, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

You must have either Python or Java JDK installed. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and Java JDK from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

### Running the program

#### For Python

```bash
python travel_cost_calculator.py
```

#### For Java 

```bash
javac TravelCostCalculator.java
java TravelCostCalculator
```

## Working on the Code <a name="working-on-the-code"></a>

If you do the assignment on Github code space, follow instructions we've given before, push your changes and create the PR. 

If you do the project locally, we would recommend you to compress the source folder, rename it with your index number and upload it to LMS. 


## Evaluation <a name="evaluation"></a>

Your task will be evaluated on the following parameters:

1. Quality of code.
2. Effectiveness of improvements.
3. Code standard compliance.
4. Clarity and usefulness of comments.
